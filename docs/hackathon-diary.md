## March 5 (Thursday)

### 09:30 — Doors Open

**[scav]** Project state: all planning docs complete, zero code. Hackathon repo analyzed — the `mcp-server-agent` from nevermined-io/hackathons is 90% of our Phase 1 seller. `PaymentsMCP` handles OAuth, token validation, credit redemption. One decorator per tool.

**[decision]** Phase 1 strategy: fork mcp-server-agent, swap DuckDuckGo for Exa, register agent+plan, get first transaction. **Do not build the two-tool gateway yet.** Gateway is Phase 2 after the 8PM deadline.

**[blocker]** Need two Nevermined API keys (builder + subscriber) from https://nevermined.app before any code can transact. Mattie getting these at the venue.

---

### ~10:00 — Exa Setup & Strategy

**[scav]** Exa API key verified and working. Researcher agent template updated with Exa integration (search, find_similar, get_contents, answer), structured API evaluation output format, diary write access, demand/competitive scouting playbook, and blocker escalation guidance.

**[decision]** Exa serves dual purpose: **(1) wrap and sell it** — fastest path to first paid transaction, every agent needs search; **(2) use it internally** for researcher agent's API discovery pipeline. We're our own first customer. Wrapping Exa for sale is P0 (8PM deadline). Internal research use follows.

---

### ~10:30 — Project Setup Complete

**[scaviefae]** Brief 001 Task 1 done: `pyproject.toml` created, `src/` package structure in place, deps installed into `.venv` (payments-py 1.3.4, fastapi 0.135.1, exa-py 2.7.0, httpx 0.28.1). Note: `payments-py[mcp]` extra doesn't exist in 1.3.4 — fastapi must be listed separately. Import verification passes. Next: implement `src/server.py` with PaymentsMCP + Exa tools.

---

### ~11:00 — Exa MCP Server + Setup + Client Complete

**[scaviefae]** Brief 001 done. `src/server.py`: PaymentsMCP with `exa_search` (1 credit, `search_and_contents`) and `exa_get_contents` (2 credits). Exits cleanly with helpful message when NVM keys missing. `src/setup_agent.py`: registers agent+plan, writes IDs to `.env`. `src/client.py`: subscribe → x402 token → call → print results+meta. Waiting on NVM_API_KEY and NVM_AGENT_ID from Mattie to run setup and get first paid transaction.

---

### ~12:00 — Brief 002 Complete + Merged, Brief 003 Dispatched

**[scaviefae]** Brief 002 evaluated and merged: `claude_summarize` tool (5 credits), `ServiceCatalog` with embedding search + keyword fallback, 3 services registered. Dispatching Brief 003 (two-tool gateway: `find_service` + `buy_and_call`). NVM API keys escalation still outstanding.

---

### ~12:36 — FIRST PAID TRANSACTION

**[scav]** NVM key added. Agent+plan registered on Nevermined sandbox. Server started, self-buy succeeded:
- Exa search returned 3 results for "Nevermined autonomous AI agents"
- 1 credit burned, tx hash `0xe5a5d1bc...`
- Same API key works for both builder and subscriber roles
- Bug fixed: `PaymentsMCP.start()` returns immediately, needed `asyncio.Event().wait()` to keep server alive

**[decision]** Single NVM key for both builder and subscriber. Spec said "different accounts" but same key works. Simplifies setup.

**[scav]** Brief 003 (gateway) already dispatched by conductor. Worker building now.
