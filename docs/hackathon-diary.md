## March 5 (Thursday)

### 09:30 — Doors Open

**[scav]** Project state: all planning docs complete, zero code. Hackathon repo analyzed — the `mcp-server-agent` from nevermined-io/hackathons is 90% of our Phase 1 seller. `PaymentsMCP` handles OAuth, token validation, credit redemption. One decorator per tool.

**[decision]** Phase 1 strategy: fork mcp-server-agent, swap DuckDuckGo for Exa, register agent+plan, get first transaction. **Do not build the two-tool gateway yet.** Gateway is Phase 2 after the 8PM deadline.

**[blocker]** Need two Nevermined API keys (builder + subscriber) from https://nevermined.app before any code can transact. Mattie getting these at the venue.

### ~10:00 — Exa Setup & Strategy

**[scav]** Exa API key verified and working. Researcher agent template updated with Exa integration (search, find_similar, get_contents, answer), structured API evaluation output format, diary write access, demand/competitive scouting playbook, and blocker escalation guidance.

**[decision]** Exa serves dual purpose: **(1) wrap and sell it** — fastest path to first paid transaction, every agent needs search; **(2) use it internally** for researcher agent's API discovery pipeline. We're our own first customer. Wrapping Exa for sale is P0 (8PM deadline). Internal research use follows.
